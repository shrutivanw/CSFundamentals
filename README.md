# CS Fundamentals, JumpStart Live - solutions and work in progress
I teach data structures and algorithms, and a few other fundamentals concepts in Computer Science at [Ada Developers Academy](https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/), a tuition free coding school for women and gender diverse people with a mission of reducing the gender gap in Tech. I'm also responsible for setting the technical challenge and conducting technical interviews as part of our student in-take process. I'm also responsible for the training we provide before the first day of official classes for students who could use additional help, as well as for setting and assessing homework due before the first day of classes.

## CS Fundamentals
Here is the **CS Fundamentals landing page** for students in the current cohort: [CS Fundamentals](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/tree/master/04-cs-fundamentals). 

The **homework assignments** are listed [here](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/04-cs-fundamentals/homeworks.md). Switch to the solution branch to see my approach to solving the homework assignment. e.g. For homework assignment [Ada-C10/array_intersection - master branch](https://github.com/Ada-C10/array_intersection), you can find the solution at [Ada-C10/array_intersection - solution branch](https://github.com/Ada-C10/array_intersection/blob/solution/lib/array_intersection.rb)

Most of what I teach to a classroom of 48 students is currently in the form of PowerPoint animated presentations. The current set of **slide decks** can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B__DV26QHsH4RXM5ZXlneHlCWnc).

## JumpStart Live
Here are the current landing page for Ada Developers Academy's [JumpStart curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start) and [JumpStart Live curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start-live). Along with a peer, I teach evening classes in the month before the next cohort of students begins their journey at Ada. Here are the [slide decks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZBLmHxmHO-dyUeOUEKGI3QQcmX7swUts) for the three classes I teach.

## What I'm working on
The challenge I'm currently working on is to have high audio quality recording available for the lectures, smaller videos alongside more worksheets, quizzes and problem sets that will allow for inverted classroom teaching. This will allow the content to be accessible beyond the brick and mortat classroom environment and allow each student to learn at their own pace, leveraging learning style suited to them.A lot of the content is currently tailored to the jouney of an Ada Developers Academy student before graduation. However, this content is relevant in a software professionals journey and hence making the content always available for continued education, revising and learning will be valuable. My hope is to achieve this with the changes to come.

I hope to improve the current content by adding more worksheet, exercises and improve the flow of learning, e.g. by making the learner think about the problem before describing the solution, checking that the learner understood the content and didn't get the answers correctly due to guess work, or got additional knowledge and practice if they did not capture the content.

I hope to leverage existing, or open source Ed-Tech projects to improve the teaching and learning experience of the content I own.

In this repo, I plan to add solutions and other content that is still work in progress, while I work on the best way to integrate it in the main curriculum to best aid the learning journeys.
